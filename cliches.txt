A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Ace in the hole.
Ace up his sleeve.
The acorn doesn't fall far from the tree.
Actions speak louder than words.
After my own heart.
Ah, to be young and foolish...
All bent out of shape.
All bets are off.
All dressed up and nowhere to go.
All for one, and one for all.
All hands on deck.
All hands to the pump.
All heck breaks loose.
All hell breaks loose.
All in a day's work.
All in due time.
All over the map.
All paled in comparison.
All talk and no action.
All that glitters is not gold.
All that jazz.
All the bits and pieces.
To be all wet.
All's fair in love and war.
All's well that ends well.
Altitude is determined by attitude.	
Always look on the bright side.
An arm and a leg.
An idle mind is the devil's playground.
An oldie, but a goodie.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Another day another dollar.
Another nail in the coffin.
Ants in his pants.
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
Apple of my eye.
As beautiful as the day is long.
As far as the eye can see.
As good as gold.
As honest as the day is long.
As horny as a three balled tomcat.
As luck would have it.
You had me at hello.
I feel protective of you.
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?
Your dad must be a thief because he stole the stars and put them in your eyes.
Is it hot in here, or is it just you? 
heart skips a beat.
I can only see you.
Sounds like music to my ears.
I get so weak in the knees. I can hardly speak.
Beautiful on the inside and out.
