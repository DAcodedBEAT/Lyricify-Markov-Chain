# Lyricify
-------------

Python script that uses Markov chains to generate somewhat random sentences from a source (intended from text source(s) plus the two recommended files.)

Written for an English class to follow and mimic the ideas of uncreative writing and apply it to a music perspective. 

** note: lyrics are owned by their respective owners. **

## Sample usage:

python lyricify.py requested_minimum_sentence_length text_source_1 ... text_source_n

## Example Usage:

 - Open Terminal on Mac/Unix/Linux system.
 - Enter command: python lyricify.py 50 snippet_sherlock.txt top10.txt cliches.txt
 - Enjoy :)

	*** DISCLAIMER: text files must have the extension .txt in order to work ***

## Sample Output:

  - “So if I run it's not enough, you are fat!”
  - “Will your mouth still remember the taste of my eye as good as gold”
  - “I'm crazy because you are fat!”
  - “Got nothing in my head- forever stuck.”
  - “A fresh poison each week. We were born sick, But I keep cruising.”
  - “Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break.”
